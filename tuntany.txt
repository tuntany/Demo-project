Yello
Orange
Red

These are the colors of the rainbow

Fly me to the moon and let me play among the starts...
Let me see what spring is like on jupiter and mars
Fill my heart with songs and let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, hold my hands
In other words, come and kiss me
